# CS2005 Client and server
Client and server coded in java

## Following tasks:
1. Set up a test network
2. Document the protocol for cafeClient and cafeServer
3. Document the protocol for cafeClientUpdate and cafeServerUpdate and identify any problems

These are described below:

### 1. Set up a test network
Set up the following network topology using the VHDs provided for the labs. This includes two subnets that communicate via a router. Configure the subnet IP addresses as in the figure below. The hostsâ€™ IP addresses will be dynamically allocated by the DHCP server.
Demonstrate that your network is working correctly. Do this by using ifconfig, netstat, ping and Wireshark as indicated in the tutorials. In your report show the outputs of all four (using screenshots) and write a short description that clearly describes how each of these in combination show that your network is correctly working1. You must demonstrate that you can identify the IP addresses of the source and destination hosts and that you can send and receive packets between the hosts.

### 2. Document the protocol for cafeClient and cafeServer
Get a copy of cafeClient and cafeServer from BBL. Run the client and the server as you have done in the Distributed Systems tutorial. Using Wireshark, systematically capture the protocol for all the transactions. Describe these in your report using a protocol table.

### 3. Document the protocol for cafeClientUpdate and cafeServerUpdate and identify any problems
Get a copy of cafeClientUpdate and cafeServerUpdate from BBL. Run the client and the server as you have done in the Distributed Systems tutorial. Using wireshark, systematically capture the protocol for all the transactions. Describe these in your report using a protocol table as well as any problem that you have identified.
